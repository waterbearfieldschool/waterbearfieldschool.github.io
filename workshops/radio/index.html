<h1 id="winter-2025-seminar-topics">Winter 2025 Seminar Topics <a class="direct-link" href="#winter-2025-seminar-topics">#</a></h1>
<p>We're planning a series of short, informal presentations and discussions around topics of interest to the group. Below is a rough, to-be-refined categorization of technologies that seem to be of interest:</p>
<h2 id="listening-only-(short-and-long-range%2C-no-license-required)">Listening-only (short and long range, no license required) <a class="direct-link" href="#listening-only-(short-and-long-range%2C-no-license-required)">#</a></h2>
<p>In general, it is often useful in a grid-down scenario to be able to listen into ambient broadcasts (news, fire, police, emergency services).  There are various inexpensive approaches to this, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>scanners</strong> -- small radios that can receive local police, fire, and other broadcasts</li>
<li><strong>software-defined radios</strong> -- inexpensive dongles that, when connected to a laptop, can provide an intuitive graphical way of exploring received radio signals</li>
<li><strong>short-wave radios</strong> -- radios optimized for receiving broadcasts from around the globe</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-range-transceivers-(several-miles)%2C-no-ham-license">Short-range transceivers (several miles), no ham license <a class="direct-link" href="#short-range-transceivers-(several-miles)%2C-no-ham-license">#</a></h2>
<p>These are relatively inexpensive radio technologies that allow for off-grid communication within a range of a few miles (or tens of miles, with repeater nodes).   This would be useful for folks on a homestead, or perhpas within a relatively small town, to stay in touch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meshtastic</strong> (enables phone to do off-grid, mesh-networked texting via an inexpensive add-on module; unlicensed)</li>
<li><strong>GMRS</strong> (audio communication; a $35, no-exam license is required)</li>
<li><strong>Walkie Talkies</strong> (audio communication; no license required)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-range-transceivers-(100s-of-miles)%2C-ham-license-req'd">Medium-range transceivers (100s of miles), ham license req'd <a class="direct-link" href="#medium-range-transceivers-(100s-of-miles)%2C-ham-license-req'd">#</a></h2>
<p>For off-grid coordination of logistics (food, water, transport) -- e.g. after or during a storm, flood, or fire -- it seems often to be useful to communicate within a range of a few hundred miles.  A typical approach to this is to a technique (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_vertical_incidence_skywave">NVIS</a>) that bounces radio signals off the atmosphere nearly directly above the broadcasting site, so that signals land within the desired range.  The relevant bands (typically, HF), require a ham license (typically, the higher-level, 'General' license).   Example technologies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>js8call; varac</strong> -- keyboard-to-keyboard live chat, with store-and-forward capability</li>
<li><strong>winlink</strong> -- ham radio-based email program</li>
</ul>

      "content_html": "<h1 id=\"winter-2025-seminar-topics\">Winter 2025 Seminar Topics <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#winter-2025-seminar-topics\">#</a></h1>\n<p>We're planning a series of short, informal presentations and discussions around topics of interest to the group. Below is a rough, to-be-refined categorization of technologies that seem to be of interest:</p>\n<h2 id=\"receiveers-(listen-only)----short-and-long-range%2C-no-license-required\">Receiveers (Listen-only) -- Short and long range, no license required <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#receiveers-(listen-only)----short-and-long-range%2C-no-license-required\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In general, it is often useful in a grid-down scenario to be able to listen into ambient broadcasts (news, fire, police, emergency services).  There are various inexpensive approaches to this, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scanners</strong> -- small radios that can receive local police, fire, and other broadcasts</li>\n<li><strong>Software-defined radios</strong> -- inexpensive dongles that, when connected to a laptop, can provide an intuitive graphical way of exploring received radio signals</li>\n<li><strong>Short-wave radios</strong> -- radios optimized for receiving broadcasts from around the globe</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"short-range-transceivers-(send-and-receive)----(several-miles)%2C-no-exam-based-license-required\">Short-range transceivers (Send and receive) -- (several miles), no exam-based license required <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#short-range-transceivers-(send-and-receive)----(several-miles)%2C-no-exam-based-license-required\">#</a></h2>\n<p>These are relatively inexpensive radio technologies that allow for off-grid communication within a range of a few miles (or tens of miles, with repeater nodes).   This would be useful for folks on a homestead, or perhpas within a relatively small town, to stay in touch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meshtastic</strong> (enables phone to do off-grid, mesh-networked texting via an inexpensive add-on module; unlicensed)</li>\n<li><strong>GMRS</strong> (audio communication; a $35, no-exam license is required)</li>\n<li><strong>Walkie Talkies</strong> (audio communication; no license required)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"medium-range-transceivers-(100s-of-miles)----(send-and-receive)%2C-ham-license-required\">Medium-range transceivers (100s of miles) -- (Send and receive), ham license required <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#medium-range-transceivers-(100s-of-miles)----(send-and-receive)%2C-ham-license-required\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For off-grid coordination of logistics (food, water, transport) -- e.g. after or during a storm, flood, or fire -- it seems often to be useful to communicate within a range of a few hundred miles.  A typical approach to this is to a technique (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_vertical_incidence_skywave\">NVIS</a>) that bounces radio signals off the atmosphere nearly directly above the broadcasting site, so that signals land within the desired range.  The relevant bands (typically, HF), require a ham license (typically, the higher-level, 'General' license).   Example technologies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>js8call; varac</strong> -- keyboard-to-keyboard live chat, with store-and-forward capability</li>\n<li><strong>winlink</strong> -- ham radio-based email program</li>\n</ul>\n",

Ideally, students would find and place these sticks into the frame, and the sticks would be fastened / lashed to the frame for durability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"/img/mg/frame_design.png\" alt=\"\"></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These frames would then be arranged to make a 13 foot fence, with a 3 foot wide hinged gate.

The individual pickets could easily be painted or customized by students.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mg/picket_overall.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This option is relatively easy to build.  The only downside might be the cost of the lumber for the pickets.</p>\n<p>In order to get a feel for this option, we've begun with a few 1&quot;x3&quot;x8&quot; boards ...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mg/mg_picket_proto.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"picket-option-b%3A-wire-mesh\">Picket Option B:  Wire Mesh <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#picket-option-b%3A-wire-mesh\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Another simple, and less expensive option would be to use wire mesh instead of pickets.  This is a common design in various gardens.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mg/wire_fence_idea.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"picket-option-c%3A-natural-pickets\">Picket Option C:  Natural Pickets <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#picket-option-c%3A-natural-pickets\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We could still retain a more 'natural' look, as in the original concept, by using found sticks for the pickets.  This is more laborious to build (finding sticks of the appropriate size and shape will also take some time), but less expesnive.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mg/romanian.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mg/simple.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/mg/sturdy_waddle.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"mesh-fence-research\">Mesh Fence research <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#mesh-fence-research\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Picket option &quot;B&quot;

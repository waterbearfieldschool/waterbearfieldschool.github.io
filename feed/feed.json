It's part of a 5-day 'Fiber to Fabric' class that he is helping to create that will take students through the process of making textiles, from raw cotton to woven cloth.</p>\n<p>Another class in this vein, which Pete has already helped create and run once, is 'Dirt to Machine', which involves melting down aluminum (eventually, they hope to start by smelting iron) and then building a small machine using metalworking tools in the machine shop.</p>\n<p>The current DIY loom design is a Dutch design that doesn't quite fit the planned class activities;  Pete is working on a re-design now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/loom_table_s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/loom_closeup_s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>More photos <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/cGC2JCqqXthxd7sJ6\">here</a>!</p>\n",

Nick gave us a great tour, and we were able to see several machines in the machine shop in operation, powered by a rod that, back in the day was ultimately water-powered.</p>\n<p>Several museum displays seemed like they could provide inspiration for great Field School projects -- watch making, locomotion, chopstick recycling, a generator, and water power in general.  It so happens that a few days later, Pete described the 'Fiber to Fabric' class he's helping to put together at Artisan's Asylum in Allston.  We're now chatting with him about the idea of offering the class -- or, pieces of it -- at the Museum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/industry_1_small.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>More photos <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/3pAmomSRcNiE9FSV9\">here</a>!</p>\n",

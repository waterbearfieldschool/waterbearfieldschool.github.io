Ideally, students would find and place these sticks into the frame, and the sticks would be fastened / lashed to the frame for durability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"/img/mg/frame_design.png\" alt=\"\"></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These frames would then be arranged to make a 13 foot fence, with a 3 foot wide hinged gate.
